  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> My name is Sriya and I'm in grade 11 studying in T.L Kenedy Secondary School. I was born in India and I came to Canada when I was 4 years old. Most of my family lives in India and some in America, but we are the only people in my family that live in Canada. Both my parents were born in India too but my brother was born here in Canada.</p>

  <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I love drawing and making little diy things I find online. I also like nature, sunsets and any place with water because I just find it very peaceful and nice. I am down to go to nature walks and stuff like that anytime. The only thing I don't really like is the bugs that come close to you when you're walking.</p>
